# This file contains a list of all those who have contributed images for maps.
# Ideally when a new map image is added an entry is added or an existing one
# amended to identify the contributor.
#
# Thew top-level object is an array which lists all the contributors.
# Each item in the array is an object which has three fields:
#
# `name`
#   The name of the contributor. This could be their actual name or a
#   pseudonym as per their preference.
#
# `link`
#   A URL that pertains to the contributor. For example, their GitHub or
#   Steam profile.
#
# `images`
#   An array of all the images (by path) contributed by the user as strings.
#   The paths are relative to the ../images/maps/masters/ directory.
