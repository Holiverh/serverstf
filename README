# Servers.tf #####

Servers.tf is a browser-based server browser for Source games such as Team
Fortress 2 and Garry's Mod. The goal is to be able to index servers so that
far more sophisticated searches can be made that what is currently possible
with the current Source/Steam server browser.

The goal is that Servers.tf will be able to detect mods being ran by the
server and be aware of community-made game modes (e.g. Balloon Race or
Surfing) so that the user can perform richer searches to find more specific
servers.


## Developing ####

For UI stuff:

1. `cd local_repo`
1. `npm install`

1. `grunt less`; there's also a `watch` task.
